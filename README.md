This is a fork of TORCS TrackEditor v0.6.2c that adds Speed Dreams specific information to the generated xml file.

All attributes can be read from and written back to the xml file without loss.  Any attributes that can't be read or written should be considered a bug and should be reported.

All attributes except Track Lights can be edited. Support for editing these will be added in the future.  Any other attributes that can't be edited should be considered a bug and reported.

The following bugs have been fixed:
1. Fix null button exception for show start point menu item
2. Fix drawing segments using profil steps length
